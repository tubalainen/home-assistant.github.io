The goal of this getting started guide is to install Hass.io on a Raspberry Pi 3. Hass.io is our own all in one solution that turns your Raspberry PI into the utlimate home automation hub.

Follow this guide if you want to easily get started with Home Assistant or if you have none or little Linux experience. For advanced users, check our [alternative installation methods](/docs/installation/).

### {% linkable_title Hardware requirements %}

We will need a few things to get started with installing Home Assistant. Links below are linking to Amazon US. If you're not in the US, you should be able to find these items in web stores in your country.

 - [Raspberry Pi 3 model B](http://a.co/gEfMqL4) + [Power Supply](http://a.co/cgKUgkt) (atleast 2.5A)
 - [Micro SD Card](http://a.co/gslOydD). Get one that is Class 10 as they are more reliable.
 - SD Card reader. Part of most laptops. Also available as [standalone USB sticks](http://a.co/5FCyb0N) (brand doesn't matter, just pick cheapest)
 - Ethernet cable (optional, Hass.io can work with wifi too)

### {% linkable_title Software requirements %}

 - Download [Hass.io image for Raspberry Pi 3][pi3]
 - Download [Etcher] to write the image to an SD card

[Etcher]: https://etcher.io/
[pi3]: https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-build/releases/download/1.1/resinos-hassio-1.1-raspberrypi3.img.bz2

### Installing Hass.io

 1. Put the SD card in your SD card reader,
 2. Open Etcher, select the Hass.io image and flash it to the SD card.
 3. Wifi setup only: open the file `system-connections/resin-sample` with a text editor. Change `ssid` to be your network name and `psk` to be your password.
 4. Unmount the SD card and remove it from your SD card reader.
 5. Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi 3. If you are going to use an ethernet cable to supply internet, connect that too into the Pi.
 6. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the power supply so it turns on.
 7. The Raspberry Pi will now boot up, connect to the internet and download the latest version of Home Assistant. This will take about 20 minutes.
 8. Home Assistant will be available at [http://hassio.local:8123][local].
